As an intern, my projects involded tuning values for initial buffering, refactoring a stall monitor in Kotlin used to trigger dynamic rebuffering, and I developed a UI to indicate to users when a live broadcat was interrupted due to poor network connections. I loved the opportunity to experiment and work on new features, as well as the support from my teamates even though they were multiple time zones away."

As an intern, my main project involved developing dashboards with DynaTrace that could monitor our Spring backend integrator. In addition, I also developed new REST and SOAP endpoints for the integrator. This development also allowed me to gain experience with Karate testing for APIs, as well as proper documentation practices."

As the UPIC intern, I mainly worked on the building occupancy modeling project, where I analyzed data to create ML models that would predict future building occupancies. This internship was mainly research-based, and allowed me to gain experience with libraries such as Facebook Prophet, XGBoost, Scikit-Learn and Pandas. I also was able to practice my SQL skills for data collection."
