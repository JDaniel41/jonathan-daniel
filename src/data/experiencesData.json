As an intern, my projects involded tuning values for initial buffering, refactoring a stall monitor in Kotlin used to trigger dynamic rebuffering, and I developed a UI to indicate to users when a live broadcat was interrupted due to poor network connections. I loved the opportunity to experiment and work on new features, as well as the support from my teamates even though they were multiple time zones away."
