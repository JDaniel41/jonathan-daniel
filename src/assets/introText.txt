Hi! My name is Jonathan Daniel, and I am a Junior National Scholar at Clemson University studying Computer Science.

My passion for Computer Science is interwoven with my love of creation. When my friends ask my why I chose to go into the field, I always tell them that to me, coding is just like creative writing.
